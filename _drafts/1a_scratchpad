# Anchor varialbes


## claude

 New feature: Named anchors for reusable anchor definitions

You can now define named anchors and reuse them across multiple fields using the new `anchorDefinition` type. This eliminates redundant anchor configuration and enables cleaner syntax when multiple fields share the same anchor logic.

Define a named anchor with `"type": "anchorDefinition"` and a `name` parameter, then reference it in other fields using `"anchor": {"ref": "anchor_name"}`. Named anchors work within Conditional methods, allowing you to define language-specific or context-dependent anchors that can be referenced by subsequent fields.

For more information, see [Reuse anchor variables](https://docs.sensible.so/docs/anchor#reuse-anchor-variables)..

### Deprecation: Sensible Instruct visual authoring tool

We've removed [Sensible Instruct](doc:https://docs.sensible.so/changelog/april-2023#visual-authoring-with-gpt-4-sensible-instruct), a visual tool for authoring LLM-based SenseML methods that augmented JSON-based authoring. Stay tuned for new ways to author LLM-based methods in future.

By default, you now author all SenseML methods in JSON and view extracted document data in a compact visual format. You can also switch between viewing output visually or as JSON.

# Instruct deprecation

## Claude

### Deprecation: Sensible Instruct visual authoring interface removed

The Sensible Instruct visual authoring interface has been removed. Configuration authoring is now exclusively done in JSON using SenseML syntax.
The updated interface provides a streamlined experience with compact visual output representation and JSON output in the right pane. You can toggle between these views while working entirely in the JSON-based SenseML editor.
Previously supported Sensible Instruct methods (Query, List, and Table) remain available as SenseML methods with JSON configuration.
