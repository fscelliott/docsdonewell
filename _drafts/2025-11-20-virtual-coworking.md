"title": "Virtual coworking for camaraderie (not productivity)"
---

I've spent the last 6 months participating in -- let's see -- 81 coworking sessions with Flow Club. I'm such a fan! It doesnt' really affect my productivity for client work, since I chose a profession where I get to be in flow most of the time anyway. But the sense of camaraderie is transformative. I enjoy meeting up with my clients, but that's usually only once or twice a year in person. Also documentation lends itself to independent, autonomous work, so the need for a video chat rarely arises. It's a breathe of fresh social cheer to see other like-minded people in tech, the arts, academia, medicine, etc., and just ... tell them what I'm up to. And cheer them along in their tasks. I particularly like cheering on the PhD dissertation students because man, that is an existentially TOUGH writing job. It's totally different from coworking spaces or coffee shops, which I gave up on because they were uncomfortable, requried a commute, and felt like "working alone together."

Anyway, where Flow Club *has* helped my productivity is in the realm of boring personal tasks. Nothing like cheerleading from random internet peers to get me excited about replacing my car's side mirror or repairing stucco!
