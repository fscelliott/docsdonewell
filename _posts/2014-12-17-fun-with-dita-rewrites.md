When I look back at the last 2 years as a tech writer, the moments in which 
I've had the most fun have been when 

1. I wrote a Python or Javascript tool to automate some documentation 
task...and it works! and colleagues adopt it, grassroots style! 
1. I rewrote a bunch of old crusty content for minimalism in DITA and 
shared/structured the heck out of it...without much developer input. 'Cause I 
understood it!

<div>Most recently I'm have fun with rewriting some hardware help for DITA. 
Since the hardware specs are already in DITA, I was able to single-source 
between them, plus turn a bunch of essays about hardware implementation into 
really terse tables. yay!<div>
