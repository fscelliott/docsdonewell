title: My impact as a founding docs writer
---

I usually keep track of accolades in a private running doc. Despite my aversion toward self-promo, some of these quotes are just too good not to share. These are the ones I re-read just to warm my heart:

> - "...Their documentation is best in class and from what I can tell, our engineers enjoyed integrating [the API]..." - public G2 review
>
> - "We routinely receive compliments on your docs from other founders, prospective engineering hires, regulatory pen-testers, and implementation partners." - CEO of client
>
> - "Your docs are in the #3 top sources of high-quality first prospect meetings for us" - sales team of client
>
> - "On the strength of your docs when we were an early-stage startup, many of our prospects thought we were well established and had been around for years" - CEO of client
>
> - "the way your documentation was structured-—it was built for developers. Usually when you see a company that gets that, that's usually a good smell." - case study pull quote
