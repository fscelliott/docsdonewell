I got a permanently dedicated section of our department's newsletter. *someone 
took the time to make me a logo! *I feel so loved.

The actual script they chose to feature in their newsletter this month is

apparently it had an impact, because I'm already seeing reviewers adopt it. 
Nice when it works out that way!
