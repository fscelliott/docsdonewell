"title": Wow, all my old LLM experiments are now invalid
---

Gosh, I have _really_ experienced the ["November moment"](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/18/the-ai-disruption/) when it comes to LLM-assisted docs writing.  Just a few months ago, I was getting medicore results with LLM-assisted docs. Now, I have skills and agents I've generated in Claude Code to assist me in writing docs...and it truly feels revolutionary. I'll write more about it later, but I just want to mark this moment for myself in my personal blog to remember later as a watershed.
