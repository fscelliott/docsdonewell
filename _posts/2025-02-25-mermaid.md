I've been meaning to learn [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) diagram syntax for a while; I know it would greatly empower and simplify my diagram creation process. But it stayed on the backburner recently until I had a need and realized Chat GPT is now multimodal.

So I prompted Chat to create the Mermaid code for the image I had in mind:

![Old table of contents](/assets/images/mermaid_1.png)

And I got back something pretty decent!

```
graph TD;
    A[User receives email] --> B[User sends email to Sensible]
    B --> C[Email is classified into an email type]
    C -->|If there are attachments| D[Documents classified and extracted]
    C --> E[Email is extracted]
    D --> F[Extracted data is sent and appears in the extractions history]
    E --> F

```



This code produced the following diagram:

![Old table of contents](/assets/images/mermaid_2.png)

Which I can now easily tweak as needed.
