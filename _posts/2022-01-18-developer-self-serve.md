Recently I investigated AI-powered tools for writing documentation. Of course, part of my investigation was prompted by curiosity -- will AI replace documentarians?  My initial answer is no; we still need humans to write high-quality developer docs, but tools like GPT will absolutely change how we write. And I think that'll be a good thing. I'm encouraged by early research on AI's transformative role, such as those that found that ["separate studies of both writers and programmers find 50% increases in productivity with AI, and higher performance and satisfaction"](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1631397931604488194).

Anyway, two tools that I recently investigated are:

- **Copilot labs** (powered by Codex, branched from GPT). I've see encouraging chatter about Copilot's ability to generate code from prompts among engineers on Slack, so I thought I'd try out it's "Explain code" capabilities. After all, a large part of my job lies in my ability to read and explain code! Could Copilot help me or do it better than me?
- **Theneo** -- a new developer portal tool that says it uses AI to generate Stripe-like docs.

Let's dive in!

**Installing with appropriate security**

There were a couple of things here: 

- I didn't realize that the "explain" feature is part of Copilot *Labs* not Copilot itself.  I signed up for Copilot, then installed *both* in VS Code from the Visual Studio marketplace, and made sure that I'd authorized Github in VS Code  by also installing the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github) extension.

- I also didn't want to expose any code from private codebases. So in the interest of security, in Github I (regretfully) removed any of the sharing/suggestion features for Copilot:
