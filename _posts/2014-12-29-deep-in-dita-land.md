Still chugging away in DITA-writing mode; still having fun in terms of the 
intellectual underpinnings.... 


....But at times, the sad state of DITA tool implementation gets to me; I wish 
the tools were 'transparent' and allowed me to focus on content, but often 
they get in the way with interaction design right out of the 1980s. For 
example, this popup in our Content Management System as been a thorn in my 
side recently (C'mon, everyone hates popups, and I *know* I made a change; you 
don't need to tell me! Especially when you don't offer an 'undo' function, and 
when you popup silently in multiple windows, forcing me to hunt through them 
all till I can resume my work...):
