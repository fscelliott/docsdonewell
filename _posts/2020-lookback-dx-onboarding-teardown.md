When I take on a new client, I like to take advantage of my fresh eyes to walk through the onboarding steps a developer takes to get to Hello World and/or first meaningful call.  I also like to walkthrough an initial impression of the docs.


I did the same when I took Optimizely on as a client back in March 2020. (Hello - I started just as covid-19 hit the USA! I still remember a coworker in San Francisco cancelling an afternoon meeting because "we're about to go into lockdown." It got real, real fast.)

As we wrap up 2020 (whew, whom amongst us is not glad to see its tail end?), I'd like to look back at my teardowns as a measure of my impact on the dev docs. 

Here are the teardowns:
