## Sensible overview

Sensible is a SaaS startup that builds a document automation product for developers. The primary reason our customers use our product is to turn PDFs, Word documents, document images (PNG, JPEG, & TIFF), Excel spreadsheets, and CSVs into structured JSON data via API. This conversion supports features they build in their own products, facilitates database storage, and supports internal business workflows.

Our customers use Sensible's core document automation features via a JSON-based domain specific language, SenseML, the provides developers with a variety of methods for parsing document data. These methods fall into two large categories: layout-based methods, and LLM methods. The layout based methods use the spatial organization of a document to identify and extract relevant data. This approach is fast and typically very accurate, but requires writing a separate parser in SenseML for each document layout. The LLM methods identify and extract data across arbitrary layouts. They have a longer response time, but are the only way to tackle corpora with many layouts or unknown layouts, and corpora composed primarily of prose (e.g., legal agreements).

While our customers can write SenseML from scratch themselves in our UI, many prefer to use our customer success engineering team to implement the document parsers they need on their behalf. This offering, which we call managed services, allows our customers to focus on building their own features and running their business while we use our extensive document automation expertise to fully address their document automation needs.

In addition to Sensible's core parsing technology, we have several features that support document automation workflows in production: a devops dashboard for monitoring live document extraction traffic, a human review UI for enabling human-in-the-loop parsing workflows, and several ways to measure the quality of extracitons.

There are many document automation solutions in the market, and Sensible wins in competitive situations where power, flexibility, and accuracy are paramount. Pricing-wise, we typically charge on a per-document basis (vs per-page), and thus are attractive for high page count use cases. Our customers are typically technical, either another startup or a business with an internal engineering staff to manage the integration of Sensible's APIs into their products and workflows.
