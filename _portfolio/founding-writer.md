For an example of a docs site I authored as a founding writer, see [Sensible documentation](https://docs.sensible.so).

I was the fifth person to join Sensible, which has since grown to a 20+ person team. I authored their docs from scratch and contain to be the sole author for their API reference, guides, SDK references, and code samples.
