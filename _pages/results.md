## Developer experience

### "You have good developer product editorial instincts" RE a domain-specific language for which I help with consistency and naming conventions: 
   "“absolutely” intuitive to write...My goodness." & "Beautiful. Amazing. I think this is great."

## Docs

### Good review on G2

"...Their documentation is best in class and from what I can tell, our engineers enjoyed integrating the Sensible API..."

- What do you like best about Sensible?
"...The API is reliable and easy to integrate. The documentation is well-written and easy to follow..."

### "Your docs are in the #3 top sources of high-quality first prospect meetings for us"

### "On the strength of your docs when we were an early-stage startup, our prospects thought we were well established and had been around for years"

### "We routinely receive compliemnts on your docs from other founders, prospective engineering hires, regulatory pen-testers, and implementation partners. For example:

"what drew us to Sensible was that you guys were developer-first...The way your API was structured, the way your documentation was structured—it was built for developers. Usually when you see a company that gets that, that's usually a good smell."
